st.markdown("""
Based on the analysis:
- **CXC Global** (APAC Sales Growth, Platform Innovators): Focused hiring in APAC across technical and leadership roles suggests a regional tech hub strategy. Strengthen platform integrations, localized support, and engineering presence to stay competitive.
- **Deel** (Broad hiring across functions): Aggressive hiring in Sales, Marketing, and Payroll reflects global enterprise scaling. Counter with tailored onboarding flows, automation, and trust-focused compliance solutions.
- **Multiplier** (Compliance & Cross-border Operations): High emphasis on payroll and compliance roles indicates specialization in cross-border delivery. Enhance LATAM-specific features and promote unified platform experience to challenge them.
- **People 2.0** (Backend Ops Stability): Hiring patterns suggest operational maturity and backend stability. Differentiate with advanced automation, client analytics, and seamless integration options.
- **Remote** (Client Enablement & Global Support): Hiring signals a remote-first support and enablement model. Prioritize localized onboarding, integration flexibility, and support SLAs to compete in service quality.

- Deel‚Äôs high volume shows aggressive expansion across core functions‚Äîthis gives them speed in enterprise sales cycles.
- CXC‚Äôs smaller count but technical APAC hiring is strategic and efficient‚Äîless noise, more precision.
- Remote and Multiplier show more focused plays in client support and compliance respectively.
- People 2.0 seems to focus on stable delivery, not expansion.

üí° **Sales Tip:** Where Deel scales fast, Papaya should pitch faster time-to-value. Against CXC, stress plug-and-play integrations.
